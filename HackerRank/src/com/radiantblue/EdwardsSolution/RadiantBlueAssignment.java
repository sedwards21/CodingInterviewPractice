 * An interface for candidates for software development positions to implement.
 * Candidates should feel free to define any methods or variables within his/her

 * 
 * 1) Limit yourself to one outer class (the implementation of this interface)
 * 
 * 2) Name the class <Last Name>Solution within the package
 * com.radiantblue.homework.solution
 * 
 * 3) There must be a no-arg constructor for this class which we will use to
 * instantiate a test of your solution
